The annual UK Rasch User Group Day is a chance for all Rasch enthusiasts to meet, discuss and present their work.

Established in 2006 the day is organised by Peter Tymms, Chris Wheadon, Tom Bramley and Tim Croudace.

Presentations are welcome from work at all stages of conception and from all disciplines. Everyone is welcome, from beginners through enthusistic amateurs, to advanced practitioners. The cost of attendance is kept as low as possible, and we are always looking for volunteers to host the day for us. Please register on the site to keep up to date with news of the day. Feel free to contact me for more information:
