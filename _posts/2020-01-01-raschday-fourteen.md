We are pleased to announce that Oxford University Press will be hosting the 2020 UK Rasch User Group meeting on **Friday 20 March** at their Oxford office in Great Clarendon Street, OX1 6DP.

The UK Rasch user group is a relatively informal, friendly forum for those working with the Rasch model in education, healthcare or any other field to get together for sharing ideas and presenting work.

Registration is free and includes lunch and coffee/tea.

Refreshments and introductions will start from 9:30 and the first presentation will begin at 10:00. The day usually ends around 4:30 – more details on timings will be provided nearer the time.

## Register to attend 

If you would like to attend the Rasch User Group meeting on **Friday 20 March**, please email <assessmentadmin@oup.com> by Friday 28 February, stating **'Attend Rasch Day'** in the subject header.   

## Register to present 

If you would like to give a presentation, please send an abstract to <assessmentadmin@oup.com> by **Friday 31 January**, stating **'Presentation for Rasch Day'** in the subject header, and attach your abstract. Abstracts should be between 200-250 words.

We welcome a broad range of topics including (for example):
Philosophical issues of measurement in the social sciences
Practical issues: ‘solving measurement problems with the Rasch model’
Accessible explanations of technical issues (e.g. reliability, fit, estimation)
Demonstrations/comparisons of Rasch software.

The length of presentations will depend on how many abstracts are submitted – we aim to allow everyone who wants to present to do so. If any selection process is needed the criteria will be the quality of the abstract and the extent to which the proposed presentation is about the Rasch model.
We look forward to seeing you on **20 March**.
