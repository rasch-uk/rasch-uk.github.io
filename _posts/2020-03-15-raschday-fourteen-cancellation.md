Due to the increasing threat from COVID-19, we have taken the decision to postpone the Rasch UK Day scheduled for 20 March. We apologise for any inconvenience caused but, given the current situation, we felt that it was unwise to hold a large event that might put participants at risk. We will be monitoring the situation and will work with the Rasch UK group to hopefully find a slot later in the year to hold the event.

We thank you for your understanding in this matter and hope that you all stay safe and well during this difficult time.
